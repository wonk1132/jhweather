For a localhost setup for scala development, there is likely nothing to do except to clone this project in order
to run it either with SBT directly or with an editor such as IntelliJ.

Hints:

 - to start up the server, you can `sbt run` from the root of this directory. That should start the server up.
 - with the host up, you can `curl http://localhost:8080/forecast/short/lat/39.3/lon/-97.08` to get a forecast.
 - not all lat/lon are supported (the National Weather Service itself does not support all lat/lon), so if we
   pass them a lat/lon they could 404.
 - you can run the test suite with a `sbt test`
